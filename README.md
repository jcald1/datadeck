# DataDeck
DataDeck is a sales lead generation tool.  The long-term plan is to create a tool that aggregates contact data from various sources to provide a source of sales leads that can be used by non-profits and for-profit organizations.

The current functionality consists of:
1) User uploads land ownership records from LandVision.
2) DataDeck matches records from LandVision owner entities to the (<a href="https://www.sos.ca.gov/">Secretary of State SOS CA)</a> entity (LLC/Corporation) records
3) Matching the natural person records above with phone number and emails from online people contact databases.
